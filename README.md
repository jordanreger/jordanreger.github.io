# jordanreger/notes
I maintain this site with Apple Notes and a Shortcut.

I spent quite a while trying to get it to work because Apple doesn't let us export Notes very easily, but I finally managed it. It's also quite simple; this was my ultimate requirement because above all, I'm using Apple Notes (and this workflow) for the sake of simplicity.

# The Shortcut
I can't actually share it here because I attached my GitHub access token to it. For that reason, I will share some screenshots of the flow. In the future I may duplicate it and share it here, but for now this will do.
