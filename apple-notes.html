<h1>Apple Notes</h1>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Asdf This site is powered by Apple Notes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After trying various blogging platforms, Notion, custom servers, Obsidian Publish, writing HTML,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Markdown, and JavaScript, I found Apple Notes to be the easiest way to maintain a website. Its</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">simplicity is its strength and weakness. It lacks the customizability of Obsidian, the cool integrations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of Notion, and the versatility of HTML.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, I realized that I didn’t need these features. What mattered most was simplicity. I agree</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with Steph Ango, the creator of Obsidian, about the importance of files over apps. Unfortunately,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Apple doesn’t support this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To liberate my notes, I created a Shortcut that took me a few weeks to brainstorm and a few days to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">build.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Shortcut takes the first line in the note (the title) and grabs it by title. This returns a Note type,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which allows me to access the body, summary, date created, and more. Notably, it also returns the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rich text of the note, enabling me to convert it to HTML.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I then get the file’s SHA hash and encode it to Base64, so GitHub will accept it. I send it via the API</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and commit the file. GitHub pages handles the rest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can download the Shortcut here: Upload.shortcut</span></p>
